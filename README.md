# CS52 Workshops

![](http://i.giphy.com/eUh8NINbZf9Ys.gif)

Each workshop session will be ~60 minutes on a web technology, tool, framework, or concept. It will consist of both a short presentation as well as a tutorial. The tutorial will be a written online document in the form of a markdown readme file in a git repo — you can start by forking this very repo. During the tutorial section the class will work in teams of 3 following along with the instructions in the document. The team presenting will answer questions and help the individual teams along.
