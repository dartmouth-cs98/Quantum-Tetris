## How to Set Up Backend
* Navigate to the flask directory
* Make sure you have python3 installed if not install it here https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Run this command to install flask 
```
pip install flask
```
* Lastly the following commands you will be presented with a hello worldish screen when you follow the link in the terminal
```
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
* NOTE: This is a remanent of the flask tutorial that I completed from CS52. I could have stripped it of all of its inner workings so that it would be truly a "Hello World" type set up. However, I think the already set up server will help us when it comes time to flesh out the backend
